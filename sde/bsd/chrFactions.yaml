        no central government to speak of - all territories within the State are owned
        and ruled by corporations. Duty and discipline are required traits in Caldari
        citizens, plus unquestioning loyalty to the corporation they live to serve.
        The corporations compete aggressively amongst themselves and with companies
        outside the State, resulting in a highly capitalistic society.
