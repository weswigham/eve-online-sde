        and the Amarr Empire understands this as keenly as any other nation. The Paladin
        Survey Force is one of a number of corporations that provide military contingents
        to Amarr survey expeditions. Seeing increasing market demand for more aggressive
        services than escort and facilities security, the corporation has eagerly
        provided soldiers for combat operations across the cluster.

    description: Republic Command is something of an oddity in a new order where the
        Minmatar tribes wield considerable power. In large part the Minmatar military
        has become fragmented among the tribes but a rump central command remains.
        The Republic Command has managed to retain control over those units that reported
        directly to its military council, and the elite nature of many of these forces
        has allowed the generals of the Command to retain significant influence.

    description: ORE’s research efforts in fields as diverse as moon mining and space
        colonization have brought the mining conglomerate many innovations over the
        years since it broke with the Gallente Federation. In its efforts to become
        ever more independent, ORE has assembled its most far-thinking, radical and
        slightly eccentric minds in a new division incorporated as Outer Ring Development.
        Persistent rumors of a program to create a genetically-modified Fedo capable
        of digesting Dark Ochre and excreting pure Nocxium have neither been confirmed
        nor denied.

    description: Originating as a branch dedicated to exploring deep space and laying
        claim to anything valuable found therein, Outer Ring Prospecting was eventually
        spun into a separate company in the ORE family. It is rumored to be staffed
        with hungry-looking people who tend to feel uncomfortable in crowds and spend
        a lot of time glancing out the windows of their ships, as if searching for
        something important just out of sight.
