    description: This certificate represents a level of competence in the operation
        of propulsion jamming modules, Stasis Webifiers, Warp Scramblers and Warp
        Disruptors. The holder has learned that webbers decrease the target's speed,
        while scramblers and disruptors prevent them from warping. This is a critical
        skillset for any capsuleer wishing to dictate the terms of a fight.

        a chance-based tool that, when successful, prevents the target from holding
        target locks. This is a good skillset for capsuleers specializing in small,

    description: This certificate represents a level of competence in handling small
        disintegrator turrets. The holder has learned that disintegrators are medium
        range weapons that deal more damage the longer they are active on the same
        target. They use exotic plasma charge ammunition and deal thermal and explosive
        damage. This is a good skillset for capsuleers specializing in small Precursor
        vessels based on Frigate hulls.
