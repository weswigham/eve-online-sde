    description: This certificate represents a level of competence in the operation
        of propulsion jamming modules, Stasis Webifiers, Warp Scramblers and Warp
        Disruptors. The holder has learned that webbers decrease the target's speed,

    description: This certificate represents a level of competence in the operation
        of Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) modules. The holder has learned ECM is
        a chance-based tool that, when successful, prevents the target from holding
        target locks. This is a good skillset for capsuleers specializing in small,
        medium or large Caldari Disruption vessels based on Frigate, Cruiser and Battleship
        hulls.
